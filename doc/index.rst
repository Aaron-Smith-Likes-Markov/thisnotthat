This Not That: A Data Map Exploration Tool
==========================================

This Not That (TNT) is a suite of tools, built atop the `Panel library`_, for
quickly and easily exploring data maps, as well as constructing more complex
web applications around data maps.

TNT is still in initial development stages, so bear with us as we continue
to build out features and make it easier to use.
